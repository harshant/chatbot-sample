# chatbot-sample
simple chatbot implementation using seq-to-seq 

To train the model use the dataset available at http://ec2-18-232-83-49.compute-1.amazonaws.com/dataset.zip
instead of tst2012.zip dataset which only contains 100 samples.

The datasets are taken from http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/ and processed to get into desired format.
